Md Ahasanuzzaman is a PhD student in the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/) at [Queen's University](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/). He is working at the [SAIL Lab, Queen's University](https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/index.html) under the supervision of Prof. [Ahmed E. Hassan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hwXx34AAAAJ&hl=en). He completed his MSc from the same Lab under the supervision of Prof. Ahmed E. Hassan. Before coming to Canada for graduate study, he worked as a Lecturer at the Computer Science Department in [Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)](https://www.aust.edu/). He finished his undergraduate study in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh](https://www.cse.du.ac.bd/). He won the prestigious Prime Minister Gold Medal Award (the highest recognition for undergrads in Bangladesh) for his outstanding undergraduate results.

His research focuses on uncovering novel insights and innovative solutions to critically challenged and widely recognized problems in software engineering. He is dedicated to advancing the productivity of software practitioners through the automation of essential software development tasks, such as recommending appropriate code reviewers and predicting defect-prone modules, thereby alleviating the workload of practitioners and improving overall software quality. Through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, natural language processing (NLP), and rigorous empirical analysis of large-scale data and mining software systems/repositories, he aims to address critical challenges in developer engagement, software quality assurance, issue management, the mobile app ecosystem and the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). He has already published 11 peer-reviewed publications (7 journal papers and 4 conference papers) in top-tier journal/conferences such as  [TSE (Scopus IF: 8.6)](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts), [EMSE (Scopus IF: 6.2)](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664), [MSR (Core A)](https://conf.researchr.org/series/msr), and [SANER (Core A)](https://saner2021.shidler.hawaii.edu/).
