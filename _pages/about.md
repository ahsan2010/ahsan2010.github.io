I am a PhD student in the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/) at [Queen's University](https://www.cs.queensu.ca/). I am working at the [SAIL Lab, Queen's University](https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/index.html) under the supervision of Prof. [Ahmed E. Hassan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hwXx34AAAAJ&hl=en). I also completed my MSc at the SAIL lab under the supervision of Prof. Ahmed E. Hassan. Before starting my graduate study, I was working as a Lecturer at the Computer Science Department in [Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST)](https://www.aust.edu/). I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering form the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, [University of Dhaka](https://www.cse.du.ac.bd/).

My work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. My [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily
focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develop new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both international relations and quantitative methodology, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
