His research focuses on uncovering novel insights and innovative solutions to critically challenged and widely recognized problems in software engineering. He is dedicated to <strong>advancing the productivity of software practitioners through the automation of essential software development tasks</strong>, such as recommending appropriate code reviewers and predicting defect-prone modules, thereby alleviating the workload of practitioners and improving overall software quality. Through the integration of <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> techniques, <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong>, and rigorous empirical analysis of <strong>large-scale data and mining software systems/repositories</strong>, he aims to address critical challenges in developer engagement, <strong>software quality assurance</strong>, <strong>issue management</strong>, <strong>the mobile app ecosystem </strong> and <strong> the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>. He has already published 11 peer-reviewed publications (7 journal papers and 4 conference papers) in top-tier journals and conferences such as <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts"><strong>TSE (Scopus IF: 8.6)</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10664"><strong>EMSE (Scopus IF: 6.2)</strong></a>, <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/series/msr">MSR (Core A)</a>, and <a href="https://saner2021.shidler.hawaii.edu/">SANER (Core A)</a>.
